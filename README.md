# Denoising Capacity of Implicit Image Representation
This project explores the denoising capacity of sinusoidsal representation networks (SIREN) when fitting directly to a noisy image. See `ipynb` file for more comments and instructions.

This is the final project of EE367: Computational Imaging, Winter 2022.
